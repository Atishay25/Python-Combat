# Python-Combat
A Web Platform that allows individuals to learn python programming in an enjoyable way, made as Course Project for CS251 - Software Systems Laboratory. The Project is inspired by [Code Combat](https://codecombat.com/play/dungeon). More detailed description of Project can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vSx5huRGWfYWPCLd9tG8xWMgfQwq6fPA-G2t3hrG_t6BA4vLyQ9DQSUnBIiPoFhfZHcY4Sg8r98gL0U/pub).

The Combat is hosted at https://prolific-pythonists.netlify.app/

## Essential Features 
- 5 Levels with different programming concepts to battle 
- **Logger** with success/failure messages and ``print`` statements for debugging
- **Code Editor**
  - Used [Code Mirror](https://codemirror.net/) Library for creating a Code editor
  - Syntax highlighting using Code Mirror Themes, modes and several Addons for different Programming languages
  - Ability to get code from uploaded file using JavaScript Function
  - Suggestions/Auto-completions using CodeMirror Hints 
- **Arena**
  - Dynamic Configuration of Arena at each level
  - Each battle sets up a different placements of objects on reloading, that is it is Dynamically sets itself (**Bonus part**)
  - Each Battle fought on different arena settings with a unique Theme and underlying Programming concept
- Used **Doxygen** for Report and Documentation. For Documentation of the Project, refer to the index.html file in html folder of this Project. For viewing the documentation, please download the html.zip and latex.zip files, unzip them and open index.html in html folder.
## Extra Features
- **Hint** Button at every level to assist the user with some help
- A **Tutorial** at start of every level to teach some basic part of Programming concept that is being used in the level
