# Python-Combat
A Web Platform that allows individuals to learn python programming in an enjoyable way, made as Course Project for CS251 - Software Systems Laboratory. 

Description of Project can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vSx5huRGWfYWPCLd9tG8xWMgfQwq6fPA-G2t3hrG_t6BA4vLyQ9DQSUnBIiPoFhfZHcY4Sg8r98gL0U/pub)

Works remaining:
- **level 2,3,4,5**
- log box of success/error message and print statements for debugging
- line by line execution of code in editor (bonus)
- Report and Documentation (Sphinx!). These are steps as far as I remember:
    - ```sphinx-quickstart```
    - Uncomment 3 lines in ```source/conf.py``` and change ```.``` to ```..``` in 3rd line
    - Inside source directory, run ```sphinx-apidoc -o . ..```
    - Run ```sphinx-build -b html source build```
- And, design, more interactiveness
