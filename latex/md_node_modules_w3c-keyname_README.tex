Tiny library that exports a function {\ttfamily key\+Name} that takes a keyboard event and returns a \href{https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/KeyboardEvent/key}{\texttt{ {\ttfamily Keyboard\+Event.\+key}}}-\/style string. Will use the actual {\ttfamily key} property of the event if available, and fall back to a value synthesized from the {\ttfamily key\+Code} otherwise.

Probably often wrong on non-\/\+US keyboards, since the correspondence between a key code and the character it produces when shift is held is predicted based on a hard-\/coded table. Meant as a fallback for {\ttfamily Keyboard\+Event.\+key}, not a replacement.

The lookup tables from key codes ({\ttfamily event.\+key\+Code}) to names are exported as {\ttfamily base} (when Shift isn\textquotesingle{}t held) and {\ttfamily shift} (when Shift is held).
