Tiny D\+O\+M-\/element creation utility. Exports a single (default) value, which is a function that you call with\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item A tag name string or D\+OM element.
\item Optionally an attribute object mapping names to values. When the values are strings, they are added to the element with {\ttfamily set\+Attribute}. When they have another type, they are assigned as regular properties (mostly useful for event handlers via {\ttfamily onclick} and such). When an attribute\textquotesingle{}s value is null or undefined, it is not assigned.
\item Any number of children, which may be null (ignored), strings (added as text nodes), D\+OM nodes (added), or arrays (each element is added separately).
\end{DoxyItemize}

The function returns a D\+OM element.\hypertarget{md_node_modules_crelt_README_autotoc_md1038}{}\doxysection{License}\label{md_node_modules_crelt_README_autotoc_md1038}
