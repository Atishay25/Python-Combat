A Web Platform that allows individuals to learn python programming in an enjoyable way, made as Course Project for C\+S251 -\/ Software Systems Laboratory. The Project is inspired by \href{https://codecombat.com/play/dungeon}{\texttt{ Code Combat}}. More detailed description of Project can be found \href{https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vSx5huRGWfYWPCLd9tG8xWMgfQwq6fPA-G2t3hrG_t6BA4vLyQ9DQSUnBIiPoFhfZHcY4Sg8r98gL0U/pub}{\texttt{ here}}.

The Combat is hosted at \href{https://prolific-pythonists.netlify.app/}{\texttt{ https\+://prolific-\/pythonists.\+netlify.\+app/}}\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md1}{}\doxysection{Instructions}\label{md_README_autotoc_md1}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Click on {\bfseries{Start}} button on the home page to start the {\bfseries{Combat}}
\item Choose the level which you want to play. There are 5 levels in the game

\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md2}{}\doxysection{Theme}\label{md_README_autotoc_md2}
The warrior has decided to repeat the history of his ancestor {\bfseries{Thanos}}. He is on his way to collect all the Six \href{https://marvelcinematicuniverse.fandom.com/wiki/Infinity_Stones}{\texttt{ Infinity Stones}} and become the Supreme Power in Universe. But, He is intelligent and calm. He is not going to wipe out half the Universe, instead use the stones powers for well being of it. You are his friend from Earth to help him in his Journey. Each level awaits a infinity stone on success. You along with the warrior already have the mind stone with you. So, use it to collect the rest of the 5 stones and help the warrior for achieveing his aim. \hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md3}{}\doxysection{Levels}\label{md_README_autotoc_md3}
