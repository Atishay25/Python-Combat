The {\ttfamily silent} template outputs nothing at all. Why would that be useful? Primarily for running J\+S\+Doc as a linter to check for syntax errors and unrecognized tags in documentation comments, although it may also be useful for testing or benchmarking purposes.\hypertarget{md_node_modules_jsdoc_templates_silent_README_autotoc_md617}{}\doxysection{U\+S\+A\+GE}\label{md_node_modules_jsdoc_templates_silent_README_autotoc_md617}
\begin{DoxyVerb}./jsdoc myscript.js -t templates/silent -a all --pedantic

This command exits with a non-\/zero exit code if any errors are encountered. It writes nothing to disk and the only output it produces is any error messages written to {\ttfamily stderr}. This command can also be used to warn about tags which are unknown to J\+S\+Doc by setting {\ttfamily \char`\"{}allow\+Unknown\+Tags\char`\"{}\+: false} in a configuration file.
