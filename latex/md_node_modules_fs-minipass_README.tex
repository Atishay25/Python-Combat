Filesystem streams based on \href{http://npm.im/minipass}{\texttt{ minipass}}.

4 classes are exported\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Read\+Stream
\item Read\+Stream\+Sync
\item Write\+Stream
\item Write\+Stream\+Sync
\end{DoxyItemize}

When using {\ttfamily Read\+Stream\+Sync}, all of the data is made available immediately upon consuming the stream. Nothing is buffered in memory when the stream is constructed. If the stream is piped to a writer, then it will synchronously {\ttfamily read()} and emit data into the writer as fast as the writer can consume it. (That is, it will respect backpressure.) If you call {\ttfamily stream.\+read()} then it will read the entire file and return the contents.

When using {\ttfamily Write\+Stream\+Sync}, every write is flushed to the file synchronously. If your writes all come in a single tick, then it\textquotesingle{}ll write it all out in a single tick. It\textquotesingle{}s as synchronous as you are.

The async versions work much like their node builtin counterparts, with the exception of introducing significantly less Stream machinery overhead.\hypertarget{md_node_modules_fs-minipass_README_autotoc_md1133}{}\doxysection{U\+S\+A\+GE}\label{md_node_modules_fs-minipass_README_autotoc_md1133}
It\textquotesingle{}s just streams, you pipe them or read() them or write() to them.

Path string is required, but somewhat irrelevant if an open file descriptor is passed in as an option.

Options\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily fd} Pass in a numeric file descriptor, if the file is already open.
\item {\ttfamily read\+Size} The size of reads to do, defaults to 16MB
\item {\ttfamily size} The size of the file, if known. Prevents zero-\/byte read() call at the end.
\item {\ttfamily auto\+Close} Set to {\ttfamily false} to prevent the file descriptor from being closed when the file is done being read.

Path string is required, but somewhat irrelevant if an open file descriptor is passed in as an option.

Options\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily fd} Pass in a numeric file descriptor, if the file is already open.
\item {\ttfamily mode} The mode to create the file with. Defaults to {\ttfamily 0o666}.
\item {\ttfamily start} The position in the file to start reading. If not specified, then the file will start writing at position zero, and be truncated by default.
\item {\ttfamily auto\+Close} Set to {\ttfamily false} to prevent the file descriptor from being closed when the stream is ended.
\item {\ttfamily flags} Flags to use when opening the file. Irrelevant if {\ttfamily fd} is passed in, since file won\textquotesingle{}t be opened in that case. Defaults to `\textquotesingle{}a'{\ttfamily if a}pos{\ttfamily is specified, or}\textquotesingle{}w\textquotesingle{}\`{} otherwise.
