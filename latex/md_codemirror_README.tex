Code\+Mirror is a versatile text editor implemented in Java\+Script for the browser. It is specialized for editing code, and comes with over 100 language modes and various addons that implement more advanced editing functionality. Every language comes with fully-\/featured code and syntax highlighting to help with reading and editing complex code.

A rich programming A\+PI and a C\+SS theming system are available for customizing Code\+Mirror to fit your application, and extending it with new functionality.

Either get the \href{https://codemirror.net/5/codemirror.zip}{\texttt{ zip file}} with the latest version, or make sure you have \href{https://nodejs.org/}{\texttt{ Node}} installed and run\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}npm install codemirror
\end{DoxyVerb}


{\bfseries{N\+O\+TE}}\+: This is the source repository for the library, and not the distribution channel. Cloning it is not the recommended way to install the library, and will in fact not work unless you also run the build step.\hypertarget{md_codemirror_README_autotoc_md323}{}\doxysubsection{Quickstart}\label{md_codemirror_README_autotoc_md323}
To build the project, make sure you have Node.\+js installed (at least version 6) and then {\ttfamily npm install}. To run, just open {\ttfamily index.\+html} in your browser (you don\textquotesingle{}t need to run a webserver). Run the tests with {\ttfamily npm test}.
